There have been several occasions when <strong>&quot;Salaam Zindagi&quot;</strong> friends have taken self-initiative and conducted events for spreading awareness.
    <br />
    Dear Friends

We are happy to inform you that in just 5 years we have over 90,000 donors and 50 members from various parts of the country.

We are aiming to publicize about our site to the maximum extent, either by word of mouth or through the Internet. If we keep going at this rate, we should easily expand our network and get 1,00,000 blood donors enrolled by next year.

We should be able to cater the blood need of atleast 10% of the Indain population. It is not a difficault task at all if we keep spreading through word about our noble cause. We hope that any person who is in need of blood will visit our site and use our services and we wish he will definitely get the required donor information. Our sole aim is to reach out to maximum number of people possible.

We are planning to extend our services to all those who are in need of blood through the 24 hours Helpline facility. We will provide you more information on this after this comes into place.

In order to make salaam zindagi work more efficiently, we have defined our roles rather than just being called as members. All of us have to play a role in making friends2support a huge success.

We are also trying to reach atleast 2 or 3 villages and render our services for the cause of Child Education. We are collecting the necessary information and wish to execute our plans after analysing the situation over there.

We hope each one of you will come forward with your suggestions, support and help us make our projects a big success.
